PostgreSQL account: ps3136 
(Note: we changed our account from zx2249 to ps3136 because the database code in zx2249 
was input directly on the cloud database which makes it hard for us to track the code 
and changes of our database. Thus we shifted to account ps3136 and input all the database
using 'created_schema.sql' and 'InsertData.sql' file so that we can easily check our database 
through checking those two files.

We have implemented all of the functional parts of our proposal from PART 1.
